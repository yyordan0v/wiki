# Crywolf Event

[Fortress of Crywolf](/maps/crywolf) is located at the southeastern area of [Valley of Loren](/maps/valley-of-loren).
It's a front line fortress where the allied forces of humans and elves fight against the forces of [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun). The rough geographical features of the fortress made it a fortress blessed with natural barriers for defense and a key area for strategy.

[Kundun's](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun) forces haven't been able to head north and now the frontline is in a deadlock.
Therefore [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun) has commanded his troops to the [Fortress of Crywolf](/maps/crywolf) to overcome a situation.

## How to Participate

A system notice will be sent to all players in the server when the **Crywolf Invasion** is about to begin.

In order to go in the Crywolf map you can either use the **Move Menu** in game or warp through the portal in [Valley of Loren](/maps/valley-of-loren) (164,35)
