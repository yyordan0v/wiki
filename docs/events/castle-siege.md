_Guardsman NPC_

## Computation for Registration Rank

During the Guild Registration Period, guilds can announce their intentions to attack the castle.

Registration Period is the time to bid for the **top 3 slots** for the siege by using **Sign of Lord** to enhance their ranking.

If more than **3 guilds** have been registered, then rank will be calculated with the following formula:

```python title="Registration Ranking Formula"
Ranking = (Registered Sign of Lord * 5) + Guild Members Number + (Guild Master Level / 4)
```

The **Announcement of Qualified Guilds** announces all the guilds that have been **accepted** into the Guild Siege.

:::tip

**Sign of Lord** can be obtain while killing monsters.

### Invading Team

|                         Guild Member                         |                        Guild Master                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |

## Basic Policy and Winning condition

To **win the Siege** the guild master's official seal should be registered in **the pedestal** located at the Dragon Tower and **if it succeeds** the Lord of a Castle **will be changed**.

![Pedestal](/img/events/cs/pedestal.jpg)

_Pedestal_

:::note

Only the **guild master can stamp** the official seal in pedestal.

:::

To stamp press it for **30 seconds**. If the 2 footholders (Crown Switches) that are needed for stamping **are cancelled** or the character **gets killed** the stamping **will fail**.

![Crown Switch](/img/events/cs/crown-switch.jpg)

_Crown Switch_

If there's a **remaining time** even if the stamping was successful, the battle **will continue** but the 2 camps of invading/defending team **will be exchanged**.

:::tip TIPS

- Warp command **cannot** be used during the Siege Warfare but the defending team **can warp in front of the castle** by using "Town portal scroll".
- Attacking own troops is only possible by pressing `CTRL` key. Be careful!

:::

The guild with their official seal stamped **at the end of the siege** will be pronounced as **Owner of the Castle**.

## Major Components

![Main Components](/img/events/cs/castle-structure.jpg)

### Castle Gates

The **Castle Gates** have defensive power/durability (HP) and can only be attacked during the siege.

![Castle Gates](/img/events/cs/castle-gates.jpg)

_Castle Gates_

:::info

The **Castle Gates** can be upgraded up to a **maximum of 3 stages** of defensive power and durability.

Keep on mind that upgrading and restoring **is not possible** during the battle.

:::

When a guild **wins** the castle while the **Castle Gates** are destroyed, the gates **will not be restored** until the siege is over.

:::tip

**Weapons'** durability is greatly reduced when attacking the **Castle Gates**, therefore it is strongly advised to take a [Potion of Bless](/events/castle-siege#potion-of-bless) or [Potion of Soul](/events/castle-siege#potion-of-soul) before attacking.

:::

### Guardian Statues

Recover HP/MP/AG around the **Guardian Statue**.

![Guardian Statue](/img/events/cs/statue1.jpg)

_Guardian Statue_

:::info

- Guardian statues can be upgraded up to a maximum of **3 stages** of defensive power and durability.

- Recovery rate can be upgraded up to maximum of **3 stages**.

Keep on mind that upgrading and restoring is **not possible** during the battle.

:::

![Guardian Statue](/img/events/cs/statue2.jpg)

The Guardian statues have defensive power/durability (HP) and can only be attacked **during the siege**.

:::tip

**Weapons'** durability is greatly reduced when attacking the **Guardian Statues**, therefore it is strongly advised to take a [Potion of Bless](/events/castle-siege#potion-of-bless) or [Potion of Soul](/events/castle-siege#potion-of-soul) before attacking.

:::

When all 4 statues inside the castle **have been destroyed**, the shield of the Dragon Tower **will be destroyed** as well.

![Guardian Statue](/img/events/cs/statue3.jpg)

:::note

Only the players of the defending team **can enter** through the **Shield of the Dragon Tower**.

:::

### Guard Towers

**Guard Towers** play a role in protecting the **Guardian Statues** once the battle starts.

![Guard Towers](/img/events/cs/tower1.jpg)

_Guard Tower_

**Guard Towers** attack invading parties around them.

![Guard Towers Attacking](/img/events/cs/tower2.jpg) ![Guard Towers](/img/events/cs/tower3.jpg)

_Guard Towers Attacking_

:::tip

**Guard Towers** can be attacked just like **Guardian Statues** or **Castle Gates**.

:::

### Siege Weapons

The **Siege Weapons** are placed at the respective fields of the invading and defending teams.

![Siege Wagon](/img/events/cs/siege-wagon-1.jpg) ![Siege Wagon](/img/events/cs/siege-wagon-2.jpg)

_Siege Weapons_

Click onto the **Siege Weapons** to view the menu to select the attacking location.

:::tip

Players can view the location being attacked when using the **Siege Weapons**.

:::

### Dragon Tower

The **Dragon Tower** is located at the last stop of the castle. The tower is divided into a shielded entrance and an upper floor which houses **the pedestal** with the official seal of the **Lord of the Castle**.

![Dragon Tower](/img/events/cs/dragon-tower.jpg)

_Dragon Tower_

The entrance to the **Dragon Tower** is protected by the shield which **blocks the invading team's** forces.

:::tip

To penetrate the **Dragon Tower** all 4 Guardian Statues need to be **destroyed**.

:::

### Pedestal

The upper floor of the **Dragon Tower** houses a **pedestal** with the official seal of the Lord of the Castle.

![Pedestal](/img/events/cs/pedestal-2.jpg)

_Pedestal_

When the **Guild Master** succeeds with stamping the official seal in the pedestal, their sword symbols will turn into shield and they will now have to defend the castle.

:::caution IMPORTANT

The Guild with their official seal **stamped at the end of the siege** will be pronounced as **Owner of the Castle**.

:::

### Potions

Weapon durability rapidly **deteriorates** when attacking the **Castle Gates and Guardian Statues** without first taking a potion.

Keep on mind that decreased Weapons' Durability will greatly **reduce** the weapon's attack power.

:::tip TIPS

- **Potion of Bless** and **Potion of Soul** can be used the same as regular potions by using the shortcut keys `Q/W/E`

- Shortcut key setting can be assigned by pressing `CTRL` + `Q/W/E` while pointing the cursor over the corresponding item

:::

When the player uses the **Potion of Bless** and **Potion of Soul**, potions that are being used will be indicated at the top of the screen as a buff effect.
