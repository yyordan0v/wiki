# Blood Castle

Risk your life to **Save the Archangel**. One of the strongest warriors in **Lotus Mu**, the Archangel, has secretly been laying watch over the lands that he has sworn to protect. As **Kundun's** presence approaches, the **Archangel** has been warding off all the monsters trying to invade **Lotus Mu**. But alas, our **Guardian Archangel** can not fend on his own forever.

## Entry Requirements

### Required Item

- You must craft an [Invisibility Cloak](/crafting/invitations/invisibility-cloak) in order to enter Blood Castle.
- [Invisibility Cloak](/crafting/invitations/invisibility-cloak) is crafted via Chaos Goblin Machine.
- The crafting ingredients (**Blood Bone** and **Scroll of Archangel**) can be obtained from monster drops or in [Yorskreth](/maps/yoskreth).
- Additionally, you'll also need one [Jewel of Chaos](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-chaos) for the crafting.

:::tip

For a **guaranteed** drop of the **Invisibility Cloak Ingredients** you can kill the [Dead Digger](/special-monsters/others/dead-digger) in either [Icewrack](/maps/icewrack), [Ashkavor](/maps/ashkavor) or [Land of Trials](/maps/land-of-trials).

## Game-play

### Preparation

Prior the **Blood Castle** start, the following message appear in Lotus Mu: "5 (4,3,2,1) minute (s) left before entry into Blood Castle". As soon as you see this message, go with the [Invisibility Cloak](/crafting/invitations/invisibility-cloak) to the **Messenger of Archangel** which can be found in [Yoskreth](/maps/yoskreth).

Interacting with the **Messenger of Archangel** will open a table in which you need to select the **appropriate level** of Blood Castle for your character (The [Invisibility Cloak](/crafting/invitations/invisibility-cloak) in your inventory **should be the same level**).
If you did everything correctly, then you will be taken to the **Blood Castle**.

### Blood Castle Quest

After teleporting to **Blood Castle**, talk to the wounded **Archangel**. He will tell you the story of his fall and the next coming of the monsters, which you have to defeat. The **Archangel** will challenge you to retrieve his holy weapon so that he can join the heroes of **Lotus Mu** in the fight against the troops of [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun).
