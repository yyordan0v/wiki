## Game-play

### Preparation

The **Chaos Castle** arena is square shaped with sections of the floor missing. A character can **fall off** the edge of the arena. If a character falls off the edge of the arena, they are **disqualified**.

:::note

Once the Entry Period has passed, there is a **1 minute** delay before the event starts.

### Chaos Castle Quest

When then event starts, monster will instantly spawn throughout the arena. Including other characters, there will be a total of **100 enemies** in the arena. As enemies are killed, the **Character Counter** will **decrease**.

![Chaos Castle Characters](/img/events/cc/cc-monsters.jpg)

_Chaos Castle Characters_

Once the **Character Counter** reaches **50**, sections of the outer floor will **crumble**. If a character is standing where the floor crumbles, the character will **fall off** the arena and will be **disqualified**.

:::info

The **Chaos Castle** will last for **10 minutes**, until only **one player** is alive or until **all players die**.

:::

Some of the monsters in **Chaos Castle** have a special Skill called **Explosion**, which causes strong **Knock-back**. Explosion (Range: 2) is only casted after the monster dies. The **Knock-back** effect of the Skill can cause characters to fall off the stage.

:::tip

Equipping **Ring of Fire** or **Pendant of Fire** can decrease the chances of the Explosion Knock-back (Elemental Fire Resistance). Using AOE Skills can also help avoid Explosion Knock-back.
