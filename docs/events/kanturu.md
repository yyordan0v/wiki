# Kanturu Event

Forged by the ingenuity of the Kantru inhabitants, the most recent amalgamation of life forms stands as the ultimate manifestation of terror. The overwhelming might of [Nightmare](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare) proved to be uncontrollable, leading to its captivity within [Maya](/special-monsters/event-exclusive/maya-hands) from its very inception.

If [Nightmare](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare) remains undefeated, the **`Regular Schedule`** is in effect, shifting to the **`Opened Schedule`** upon [Nightmare's](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare) defeat.

### Regular Schedule

- Occurs every 20 minutes
- Within this timeframe, all individuals entering the **Refinery Tower** are obliged to confront [Nightmare](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare).
- Entry Period **3 minute** prior to the Event starts.
- Entry Period closes one minute before the Event starts.

### Opened Schedule:

- Persists for a duration of **23 hours**, commencing immediately following the demise of [Nightmare](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare).
- Throughout this span, those entering the **Refinery Tower** are exempt from contending with [Nightmare](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare).
- After the **23-hour interval** elapses, the **`Regular Schedule`** resumes its activity.

## Hands of Maya

### Maya's Left Hand

Players are required to eliminate a total of **50 monsters** as a prerequisite for [Maya's Left Hand](/special-monsters/event-exclusive/maya-hands) to emerge. Subsequently, participants must defeat this hand within a **15-minute window**; failure to do so will result in the mandatory relocation of all players to **Kanturu Safe Zone**.
