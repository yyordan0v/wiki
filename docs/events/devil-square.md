![Charon](/img/events/ds/charon.jpg)

_Charon_

Engaging with **Charon**, will open a window with a table in which you need to select the **appropriate level** of Devil Square for your character (you should have the same level of [Devil Square Invitation](/crafting/invitations/devil-square-invitation) in your inventory).

If you did everything correctly, then you will be taken to the **Devil Square Event map**.

### Devil Square Quest

When the **Devil Square** starts, 200 monsters will instantly spawn throughout the arena. If a monster is killed, another will spawn to keep the monster count at 200.

As the time progresses, the monsters which spawn **will change** and their **difficulty** will slightly **increase**.

:::info

Monsters will continue to spawn for **20 minutes**.
