The event consists out of **two teams** who will try to get as many items from the **Stone Pedestal** NPC as possible. Once a player has received the item he will be slowed. Returning the item to the **base camp** will get the team **1 point**.

During the **Illusion Temple**, players will have applied a **skin** on their character in order to recognize the enemy team.

## Game-play

### Preparation

Prior to the start of the **Illusion Temple**, the following messages appear in the Mu Mayhem Server: "Illusion Temple will close in 5 (4,3,2,1) minute (s) ". As soon as you see such a message, go with the [Scroll of Blood](/crafting/invitations/scroll-of-blood) to **Mirage** - located in [Devias](/maps/devias). You need to have the **correct Scroll of Blood** corresponding to your **Character's level** in order to enter the Event.

If you did everything correctly, then you will be taken to the **Illusion Temple** Event Map.

### Illusion Temple Quest

The arena is large. Here's a look at the layout of the zone.
You can see both teams starting positions on the **westernmost** and **easternmost** sides of the map.

![Illusion Temple Event Map](/img/events/it/it-map.jpg)

_Illusion Temple Event Map_

**Red team** and **Blue team** spawn on opposite sides of the map.

![Blue Team Skin](/img/events/it/it_team_blue.jpg)

_Blue Team Skin_

The **Illusion Temple Ball** is located in either the **northern** or **southern** part of the map. Return the Ball to the **team's pedestal** to earn **one Game Point**.

When a ball is picked up, the character's Movement Speed will be **decreased** greatly so it's important for his or her teammates to work together to **protect the ball carrier** from the opposing team.

:::caution

If the ball carrier is **killed**, **disconnects** or **leaves** the event, the ball will **fall** to the ground and will be able to be picked up by **any player** on **either team**.

:::

The Illusion Temple Ball spawns on the **Pedestal**.

![Illusion Temple Pedestal](/img/events/it/it-pedestal.jpg)

_Illusion Temple Pedestal_

Each team's base also comes equipped with a **pedestal**, where players can bring back the event balls for points.

:::note

Once a ball is taken from the **statue**, both of the statues will disappear. They will **reappear** again once a team **returns the ball** to their respective base.
