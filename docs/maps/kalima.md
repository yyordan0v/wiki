# Kalima

**Kalima** is the forsaken realm where the formidable lord [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun) has been exiled, accompanied by his unwavering loyal followers.

_Kalima_

Entry into **Kalima** is not granted to just anyone, as stringent measures have been implemented to seal off the area and prevent any escape of its menacing inhabitants. The exclusive passage to this domain is through a specialized portal, reawakened by the elusive **Lost Map**.

_Lost Map_

Crafting a **Lost Map** requires the combination of (x5) **Symbols of Kundun**. **Kalima** comprises seven distinct difficulty levels, each tailored to warriors of specific Character Levels. It is only within the deepest recesses of the **7th floor** in Kalima that intrepid adventurers will encounter the majestic presence of lord [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun) himself.

_Symbol of Kundun_

:::tip

For a **guaranteed** drop of **Symbol of Kundun** you can kill the [Dead Porter](//special-monsters/others/dead-porter) in either [Ashkavor](/maps/ashkavor) or [Land of Trials](/maps/land-of-trials).

:::tip

The distinctive aspect of the _Regular Monsters_ within **Kalima 7** lies in the potential to acquire a [Silver Box](/items/item-bags/non-exc/silver-box) which hides the **most powerful** [Ancient Items](/items/ancient-items) in it.
