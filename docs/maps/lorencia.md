# Lorencia

**Lorencia**, a vast and flat map situated at the center of MU, marks the starting point for all characters in **Lotus Mu**.

Within this realm, one will encounter the game's least formidable creatures, alongside essential items crucial for overcoming lower levels, rendering it an ideal destination for adventurers at early stages (levels 1-20).

This dimension houses a fortified city boasting drawbridges, wall-mounted cannons, and an abundance of vigilant guards, all safeguarded by surrounding rivers, lending an air of exotic allure.

Please note that accessing **Lorencia** through the portal requires a minimum level of 10. Furthermore, utilizing the teleportation list (activated by pressing the "M" key) mandates both a minimum level of 10.
