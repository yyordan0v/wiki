# Valley of Loren

Within the expanse of the **Valley of Loren** lies the majestic **Castle**, serving as the grand nucleus of the empire and its inhabitants. This fortress stands as a testament to the empire's might, overseen by its formidable forces and the collective power of its people.

In this realm, **Guilds** engage in fierce competition, vying to showcase their strength and prowess in the [Castle Siege](/events/castle-siege) Event. At the culmination of the competition, the **Guild Master** of the strongest Guild ascends to the esteemed position of **Castle Lord**, assuming exclusive responsibilities and wielding significant influence across the continent for a designated period of time.
