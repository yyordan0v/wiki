# Kanturu Relics

During the era of the Kantur People, they embarked on a quest to harness the power of the [Jewel of Harmony](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-harmony) in order to create novel life forms. Through their advanced biotechnological skills, they discovered that the essence of generating these life forms resided within the [Jewel of Harmony's](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-harmony) potency. However, obtaining a pure [Jewel of Harmony](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-harmony) from nature proved to be an exceedingly difficult task.

Consequently, the Kantur People dedicated numerous years to perfecting a method for purifying raw [Gemstones](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/gemstone). Their tireless efforts resulted in the creation of the formidable **Refinery Tower**, where they successfully developed the science of [Gemstone](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/gemstone) purification.

Tragically, their experiments eventually led to the downfall of their civilization. In the year 1870 of Lugard, the Kantur People were already grappling with internal conflicts when the resurrection of [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun) brought about an attack on their realm. Despite their swift defeat, the **Refinery Tower** remains intact and fully operational to this day.
