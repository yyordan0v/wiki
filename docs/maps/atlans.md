# Atlans

Venture into the breathtaking expanse of **Atlans**, an oceanic realm teeming with some of Kundun's mightiest adversaries, with the [Hydra](/special-monsters/mini-bosses/hydra) reigning supreme among them. This mystical domain plays host to a legion of formidable sea creatures who have been summoned by the Hydra to safeguard the treacherous path leading to Tarkan. Standing proudly atop [Noria](/maps/noria), **Atlans** harbors colossal monstrosities far surpassing their counterparts in the verdant lands of [Devias](/maps/devias). Within **Atlans** lie coveted treasures, vigilantly protected by the watchful gaze of the [Hydra](/special-monsters/mini-bosses/hydra).
