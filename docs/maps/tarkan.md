# Tarkan

Nestled within the scorching expanse of **Tarkan**, the Desert of MU unveils a formidable realm where only the bravest dare to tread. This arid landscape serves as a battleground for fierce encounters with the mightiest of monsters. Amidst this unforgiving terrain, the elusive [Zaikan](/special-monsters/invasions/zaikan) and the fearsome **Death Beam Knight** stand as guardians of coveted treasures, luring intrepid adventurers to test their mettle.

As you traverse the desolate dunes, remnants of past warriors who dared venture into **Tarkan** serve as haunting reminders of the perils that await. Their fallen forms silently bear witness to the unforgiving nature of this merciless desert, urging caution to those who dare to follow in their footsteps.
