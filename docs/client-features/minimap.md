Furthermore, the **minimap** offers additional interactive features, allowing you to **zoom in and out** for a closer or broader view, adjust the **transparency** level according to your preference, and **relocate the minimap** on your screen by clicking and dragging its corner to your desired position.

This grants you full control over the minimap's appearance and placement, enhancing your overall gaming experience.
