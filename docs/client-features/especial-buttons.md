## Active Invasion

During periods when an invasion is ongoing in the server, the `Active Invasions` Button becomes accessible.

Upon clicking this button, a window will appear on the screen, displaying comprehensive information about the currently active invasion.

In cases where multiple invasions are transpiring simultaneously, you will have the ability to navigate through all of them, gaining insights and updates for each specific invasion.
