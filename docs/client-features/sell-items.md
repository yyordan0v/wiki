# Sell Items

Promoting your items for sale has never been easier! No more typing global messages manually. With the **Sell Items** function, all you need to do is hold the `Shift Key` and `Right Click` on your item to effortlessly send a global message that stands out from regular post messages.

To maintain a clutter-free chat environment, we've implemented a cooldown on this function, allowing you to utilize it **once** every **5 minutes**.

By pressing the `Shift Key` you will toggle the so called Trade Window, allowing you to view all the items posted for sale in one convenient location.
