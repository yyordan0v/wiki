# Global Settings

Global settings allow you to override individual material and component settings across your entire cabinet configuration. Instead of setting materials for each front, drawer, or handle individually, you can use global overrides to apply consistent settings throughout.

## Key Benefits

- Save time by applying materials consistently across all components
- Ensure uniformity in design
- Easily switch materials for an entire category (like all fronts or all drawers)
- Maintain the option to revert to individual settings when needed

## How It Works

1. Each global setting has an override toggle
2. When enabled, the global setting takes precedence over any individual component settings
3. When disabled, components use their individual settings
4. Material selections follow the same rules and filters as individual components

:::note
Global settings are optional and can be used selectively - you can choose to override just fronts, just handles, or any combination of elements.

:::tip
Global settings are particularly useful when designing cabinets with consistent material themes or when you need to quickly update multiple components at once.
