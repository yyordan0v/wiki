# Guild System

Guilds hold significant significance in the gameplay of MU Online, serving as platforms for players to establish their own close-knit communities and provide mutual assistance.

These guilds are formed with various objectives in mind, whether it's bringing together friends or consolidating collective strengths. Essentially, guilds serve as a symbol of unity within the MU Online gameplay experience.

:::note

In **Lotus Mu**, guilds have a maximum capacity of **30** members. However, if the guild master is **Dark Lord**, the guild can accommodate up to **35** members.

:::

## How to create a Guild

Creating a guild in MU Online is a straightforward process. To initiate the guild creation, players can visit the Guild Master NPC (Captain Lorence) and interact with him.

_Captain Lorence_

However, certain requirements need to be met:

- The guild master must have a minimum level of 100.
- The guild name should consist of at least 4 letters and should not include any symbols.

:::tip

You can find the Guild Master NPC in [Devias](/maps/devias) or in [Yoskreth](/maps/yoskreth).

## Guild's Mark

The **Guild Mark**, also referred to as the Guild Logo, serves as the visual representation of a guild. After expressing the intention to create a guild to **Captain Lorence**, the player is required to input the desired guild name and create a unique guild logo.

:::caution

It is important to note that once the guild's name and logo are chosen, they cannot be modified or changed.

## Guild's Position

Each community or group possesses its own distinct characteristics. In the realm of MU Online guilds, the **Guild Master** holds the authority to promote or demote members based on their perceived deserving positions.

To promote a guild member, the **Guild Master** simply needs to click on their name and locate the "Promote" button within the guild tab. Upon clicking, an option screen will appear, allowing the **Guild Master** to select the appropriate position, which could be one of the following:

- Assistant Guild Master
- Battle Master - this role can be assigned to 3 players in total

## Disbanding/Leaving Guild

Just as creating a guild is a straightforward process, leaving or disbanding a guild is equally simple.

To leave a guild, one can press the "G" key to open the guild interface and navigate to the "Guild" tab located in the left corner. From there, selecting the "Withdraw" option at the bottom of the "Guild" tab will initiate the process of leaving the guild.

Similarly, to disband a guild, pressing the "G" key opens the guild interface, and selecting the "Guild" tab is the next step. At the bottom of the "Guild" tab, there is an option to choose "Disband," which will commence the process of dissolving the guild.

## Guild's Alliance 

The option for guild alliances is not available in Lotus Mu.

## Guild's Hostility

Guilds have the ability to declare **hostility** towards other guilds in **Lotus Mu**. Once this feature is enabled, all members of the opposing guild will be visually marked as **flagged for PK** (Player Killing), allowing attacks and kills on them **without** incurring any penalties. The names of hostile guilds will appear in **red** on your screen, similar to the appearance of outlaws. 

:::tip

Engaging and defeating members of hostile guilds **will not** result in you being flagged as an **outlaw**.

## Guild's Competition

### Guild's War

Guild Masters in **Lotus Mu** have the authority to initiate guild duels by using the command "**/war**" followed by the name of the target guild. Once the challenged guild accepts the duel, members from both guilds can engage in immediate combat against each other.

If your guild is challenged to a duel by another guild master, a notification screen will appear. If you prefer not to participate in the duel, you can reject the proposal by selecting "Cancel". It is possible to receive multiple guild duel challenges while playing the game. In such cases, you can block incoming requests by enabling the "Request Off" option. Enabling "Request Off" will block all trade, party play, and guild duel requests. 

### Guild's Battle Soccer

Guilds have an additional option to resolve conflicts through a **battle soccer** challenge using the command "/soccer" followed by the name of the target guild. This game allows guilds to form parties consisting of 1-5 members on each team and compete on a field, aiming to score points and defeat the opposing team. Points can be earned by either eliminating the other team's players or by successfully scoring goals.

- Each goal scored is worth **20** points
- Eliminating an opposing player grants **1** point

The first team to reach **100 points** emerges as the winner of the battle soccer challenge.
