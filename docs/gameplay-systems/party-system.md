# Party System

A **Party** refers to a compact gathering of players who unite their efforts to efficiently vanquish monsters. By banding together, **party members** not only accelerate the process of eliminating foes but also share in the **experience points** earned and the **loot** obtained from fallen adversaries.

- A Party can have up to **5** characters in it.
- Party Members within a certain distance of each other will share **Experience Points**.
- Party Members also share **item drops**.
- Any two players can join a Party together via **Character Command**.
- The player that sends the initial Party Request will become the **Party Leader**.
- To join an existing Party, only the Party Leader can accept a **Party Request**.
- If a Party Member **disconnects** from the game, the character will remain in the Party.

## Party Window

- When you join a Party, the Party Window will appear. The window shows the real-time status of each character, including their HP, Buff or Debuff.
- To remove a Party Member, the Party Leader can click the "X" next to their name.
- The Party Leader is identified by a small flag icon next to their name.

## Party EXP Sharing

**Experience Points** (EXP) are distributed among the members of a Party. The distribution is determined by various factors, and in order to receive shared EXP, you need to be in close proximity to other Party Members.

EXP sharing within the Party is based on the Character Level of each member, following a specific ratio. The calculation of shared EXP takes into account the Base EXP obtained by the Party Member who has the highest Character Level.

## Party EXP Bonus

While actively participating in a Party, characters can receive a **Party EXP Bonus**. The bonus amount increases as **more** characters join the Party!

The Party Bonus EXP gained is determined based on the personal Base EXP of each character.

There are two types of Party Bonuses: the **General Party Bonus**, which is obtained when **any combination** of Character Classes are in a party, and the **Character Set Party Bonus**, which is acquired when a **specific combination** of Character Classes are present in a party.

|     Party Bonus     | Two Members  | Three Members | Four Members | Five Members |
| :-----------------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
|    General Party    | **-25%** EXP | **-20%** EXP  | **-15%** EXP | **-10%** EXP |
