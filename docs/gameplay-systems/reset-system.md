# Reset System

The **dynamic experience system** is designed to adjust the experience gained based on the number of resets you have performed. Its core principle is that as your **reset count increases**, the experience received gradually **decreases**. This ensures that the more powerful you become, the more challenging it becomes to level up your character.

However, with each reset, there is a compensatory effect where the amount of received stat-points and bonuses is increased. Consequently, each subsequent reset becomes more enticing and rewarding.

The table below provides a comprehensive overview of the rewards and experience points associated with each reset, offering a deeper understanding of the benefits and exp gained at each stage.
