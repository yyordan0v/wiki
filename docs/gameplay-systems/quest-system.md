# Quest System

**Lotus Mu** offers a captivating array of consecutive **quests** that not only add variety to the gameplay but also **reward** players with a plethora of prizes upon successful completion.

Our **Primary Quests** have been meticulously crafted to align with the growth and advancement of your hero. This means that you'll start off by slaying **Spiders**, then progress to **Budge Dragons**, and so forth, until you find yourself facing off against the most formidable creatures in the realm.

:::tip

We strongly advise all players to begin their quest immediately after creating their first character.

:::

Each completed quest bestows upon the player a **reward**, ensuring that they are well-equipped for their journey ahead. These **valuable rewards** will undoubtedly prove to be invaluable assets in the long run, bolstering the player's capabilities and enhancing their chances of success.

## Quest Window

As you join in the **Lotus Mu** realm you will see a **white arrow** in the middle right of your screen. When you press this arrow, the **Quest Window** will pop.
