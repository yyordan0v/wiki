# Skin System

We have embraced the concept of player self-expression by introducing the revolutionary **Skin System** - unique feature which can be encountered only in the realm of **Lotus Mu**.

This opens up the opportunity for you to modify the appearance of your [Tier 2 pets](/category/pets).

:::note

Please be aware that this functionality solely alters the pet's **appearance** while preserving its original stats.

:::

To alter the appearance of your [Tier 2 pet](/category/pets), you must infuse it with a Prismatic Gem.

_Prismatic Gem_

## Infusion Process

One such example of infusion is as follows:

|    [Necromancer](/crafting/pets/necromancer)    |                                       | [Green Fenrir Prismatic Gem](/items/jewels/prismatic-gems/fenrir-gems) |                                         |                   Green Fenrir                    |
| :---------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
| ![Necromancer](/img/items/pets/necromancer.png) | ![Plus](/img/items/invitations/+.png) |   ![Green Fenrir Prismatic Gem](/img/items/jewels/prismatic-gem.png)   | ![Equals](/img/items/invitations/=.png) | ![Green Fenrir](/img/items/pets/green-fenrir.jpg) |

The final result, **The Green Fenrir**, will retain identical stats to those of the [Necromancer](/crafting/pets/necromancer).

:::tip

You can infuse any of the three [Tier 2 pets](/category/pets) with any Prismatic Gem.
