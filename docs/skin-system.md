# Skin System

We have embraced the concept of player self-expression by introducing the revolutionary **Skin System** - unique feature which can be encountered only in the realm of **Lotus Mu**.

This opens up the opportunity for you to modify the appearance of your [Tier 2 pets](/category/pets).

The only benefit you will get from infusing your [Tier 2 pet](/category/pets) will be the **Plasma Storm Skill**. This skill **will be added** to all infused [Necromancer](/crafting/pets/necromancer) and [Spirit of Nature](/crafting/pets/spirit-of-nature) pets.

:::note

Please be aware that this functionality solely alters the pet's **appearance** while preserving its original stats.

:::

To alter the appearance of your [Tier 2 pet](/category/pets), you must infuse it with a Prismatic Gem.

## Infusion Process

One such example of infusion is as follows:

|    [Necromancer](/crafting/pets/necromancer)    |                                       |  [Green Fenrir Prismatic Gem](/items/jewels/prismatic-gems/fenrir-gems)   |                                         |                   Green Fenrir                    |
| :---------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
| ![Necromancer](/img/items/pets/necromancer.png) | ![Plus](/img/items/invitations/+.png) | ![Green Fenrir Prismatic Gem](/img/items/jewels/fenrir-prismatic-gem.jpg) | ![Equals](/img/items/invitations/=.png) | ![Green Fenrir](/img/items/pets/green-fenrir.jpg) |

The final result, **The Green Fenrir**, will retain identical stats to those of the [Necromancer](/crafting/pets/necromancer).

:::tip

You can infuse any of the three [Tier 2 pets](/category/pets) with any Prismatic Gem.

## Rarity

The skins are divided into different **Rarity Tiers** based on the chance to aquire each of them.

:::note

The **lower** the chance of aquiring a skin, the **higher** its **Rarity** will be.
