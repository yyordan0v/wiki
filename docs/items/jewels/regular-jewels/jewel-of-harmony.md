The Jewel of Harmony is **main ingredient** in a chaos combination that grants **Item Options** , commonly referred to as **pink options**.

For a more comprehensive understanding of this procedure, I highly recommend delving into the informative and insightful [Item Options](/crafting/item-options) article.

## Crafting

The acquisition of the **Jewel of Harmony** is exclusively achievable through the process of **crafting**. Although the procedure itself is relatively straightforward, there are certain factors that necessitate careful consideration.

To commence the crafting process, you must first acquire a [Gemstone](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/gemstone).

To refine these raw [Gemstones](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/gemstone) into the coveted **Jewel of Harmony**, the invaluable assistance of **Elpis** inside the **Refinery Tower** is needed.

Entrusting Elpis with the refining task ensures the successful transformation of the [Gemstone](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/gemstone) into the potent **Jewel of Harmony**, allowing you to unlock its exceptional powers.

## Harmony Options

To bestow your item with the coveted **Harmony Options** (also known as **Yellow Options**), all you need to do is effortlessly apply the **Jewel of Harmony** onto it.

The **Jewel of Harmony** is a single-use item, rendering it irretrievable for any future applications. Once it has served its purpose, the jewel is forever relinquished, unable to be reclaimed or reused. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the decision carefully before employing a **Jewel of Harmony**.
