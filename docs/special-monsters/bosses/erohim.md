# Erohim

In a distant era, **Erohim** perpetrated a heinous act of murder, taking the life of his own master, Bala. As punishment for this grievous transgression, he was condemned to eternal imprisonment in the [Land of Trials](/maps/land-of-trials).

Within this desolate realm, **Erohim** reigns, breathing life back into the fallen inhabitants. Driven by his insidious ambitions, he seeks to extend his undead dominion across the vast expanse of the MU continent.
