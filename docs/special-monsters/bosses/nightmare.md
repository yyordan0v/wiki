# Nightmare

Embark on a perilous journey into the depths of [Kanturu Relics](/maps/kanturu-relics) as we unveil the harrowing tale of the dreaded **Nightmare**.

Once a serene sanctuary, now plagued by the relentless attacks of this ancient warlord and his monstrous horde, [Kanturu Relics](/maps/kanturu-relics) hides the coveted **Refinery Tower** where impure [Gemstones](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/gemstone) are transformed into exquisite [Jewels of Harmony](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-harmony).

Join us as we delve into the treacherous path that leads adventurers to confront the formidable **Nightmare** and reclaim the sanctuary's tranquillity.

The **Nightmare** can only be defeated by participating in the [Kanturu Event](/events/kanturu).
