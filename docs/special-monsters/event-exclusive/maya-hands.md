# Hands of Maya

Within the vicinity surrounding the Maya Statue during the [Kanturu Event](/events/kanturu), both the **Left and Right Hands of Maya** materialize. These mystical beings serve as harbingers, issuing a foreboding message that the formidable [Nightmare](/special-monsters/bosses/nightmare) is on the verge of making its presence known.
