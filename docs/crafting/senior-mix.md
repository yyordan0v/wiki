# Senior Mix

In the world of Mu Online, only the mightiest warriors get to the point of controlling the **Castle**. This comes with great benefits, all of which you can check on the article about [Castle Siege](/events/castle-siege).

One of those benefits is the **Senior Mix**. In exchange for precious jewels found in the cruel world the **Senior** offers something extraordinary - the [Golden Box](/items/item-bags/misc/golden-box) which hides unimaginable treasures.

:::note

The Senior Mix can be held only **once a day**, only by the **Castle Lord**.
