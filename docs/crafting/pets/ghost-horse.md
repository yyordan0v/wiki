# Ghost Horse

In the vast and enchanting world of Mu Online, players have the opportunity to embark on thrilling adventures and conquer formidable challenges.

One such extraordinary companion is the **Ghost Horse**, a Tier 2 pet that captivates players with its ethereal beauty and powerful abilities.

As it glides through the mystical realm of Mu, its transparent form leaves a trail of wispy, ghostly echoes behind, adding an aura of mystery and enchantment to its presence.
