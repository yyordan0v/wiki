# Invisibility Cloak

Players that want to participate in the [Blood Castle](/events/blood-castle) will need to craft an **Invisibility Cloak** prior joining the event. This article covers the process of this **Chaos Mix**.

## Ingredients

To craft the **Invisibility Cloak Mix**, you'll need two essential components:

|                      Blood Fang                      |                                       |                          Scroll of Archangel                           |                                       | [Jewel of Chaos](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-chaos) |                                         |                          Invisibility Cloak                          |
