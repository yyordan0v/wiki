# Item Options

The **Item Options** are the options which in Mu Online are normally exclusive to the so called 380 Level Items. Due to the nature of our server - characters having multiple resets and a lot of stats, we decided to make these options available to all items.

The **Item Options** can be added through a **Chaos Combination**. We will further delve into the process in the following sections of the artcle.

## Ingredients

Before you add an **Item Option** to your item, you need to ensure that you have the necessary ingredients:

- [Jewel of Guardian](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-guardian)
- [Jewel of Harmony](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-harmony)
- [Jewel of Bless Bundle](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-bless)
- [Jewel of Soul Bundle](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-soul)
- [Jewel of Creation Bundle](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-creation)
- **Excellent item** that has been upgraded to a **minimum of +4**
