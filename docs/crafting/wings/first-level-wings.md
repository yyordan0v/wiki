# 1st Level Wings

In Mu Online, the wings serve as powerful equipment that enhances a character's abilities and appearance. As you progress through the game, you have the opportunity to combine **wings** and create even more formidable versions. This guide will walk you through the process of combining **1st Level Wings** to unlock great power.

## Ingredients

Before you can combine the **Wings**, you need to ensure that you have the necessary ingredients:

- [Jewel of Chaos](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-chaos)
- [Jewel of Creation](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-creation)
- [Chaos Weapon](/crafting/wings/chaos-weapon) upgraded to **minimum level of +4** and **minimum of +4 additional damage**
- **Non excellent** item that has been upgraded to a **minimum of +11** with an **option of +4 or higher**
