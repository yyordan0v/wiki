# Balgass' Baracks

Under the direct orders of [Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun), the malevolent ruler, Lemuria, the potent sorceress, was tasked with mobilizing forces to besiege [Crywolf](/maps/crywolf) and overthrow its guardians.

To fulfill this sinister objective, Lemuria appointed [Balgass](/special-monsters/bosses/balgass), a formidable warlord, as the commander responsible for constructing an unstoppable army and launching relentless assaults on the city. In swift response, [Balgass](/special-monsters/bosses/balgass) established a training ground known as **Balgass' Barracks**, ingeniously situated within the eastern caves of [Crywolf](/maps/crywolf).

It is within this training ground that his formidable army undergoes rigorous preparations, honing their skills and strategies for their forthcoming campaigns against the city's defenders.
