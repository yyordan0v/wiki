# Dungeon

The **Dungeon** stands as a formidable cave nestled to the northeast of Lorencia. Spanning across three treacherous levels, this perilous labyrinth is inhabited by the fearsome [Gorgon](/special-monsters/mini-bosses/gorgon), lurking in wait at its deepest reaches.

Driven by the allure of untold treasures hidden within these shadowy caverns, numerous valiant adventurers have ventured into the **Dungeon**, yet only a handful have returned to recount their harrowing experiences. You should possess the courage to step forward, proceed with caution, for the horrors that dwell within are but a stone's throw away from the abyss of Hell itself.
