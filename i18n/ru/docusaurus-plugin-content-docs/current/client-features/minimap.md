# Minimap

**Lotus Mu** boasts an incredibly versatile **minimap** feature, primarily designed to provide players with precise information about their character's **location** on the map.

Additionally, the minimap interface offers the functionality to initiate or halt the **3D Camera** feature, adding further flexibility to the gameplay experience.

Furthermore, the **minimap** offers additional interactive features, allowing you to **zoom in and out** for a closer or broader view, adjust the **transparency** level according to your preference, and **relocate the minimap** on your screen by clicking and dragging its corner to your desired position.

This grants you full control over the minimap's appearance and placement, enhancing your overall gaming experience.
