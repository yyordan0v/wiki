# Chaos Weapon

Mu Online offers a vast and immersive world where adventurers embark on quests, battle fearsome monsters, and engage in epic PvP battles. One of the most intriguing aspects of Mu Online is the ability to create powerful chaos items through a process known as **Chaos Weapon Mix**. This article aims to guide players through the steps of combining chaos weapons, highlighting the required ingredients, strategies for success, and the incredible rewards that await those who dare to venture into the realm of **Lotus Mu**.

**Chaos Weapon Mix** is an unique feature in Mu Online that allows players to fuse various items together to create powerful chaos weapons. These weapons possess extraordinary attributes, enhancing a player's combat prowess and unlocking new possibilities for character development.

## Ingredients

To initiate the **Chaos Weapon Mix**, you'll need two essential components:

- [Jewel of Chaos](/items/jewels/regular-jewels/jewel-of-chaos)
- **Non excellent** item that has been upgraded to a **minimum of +11** with an **option of +4 or higher**
- 10,000,000 Zen

The Jewel of Chaos serves as the catalyst for the fusion process, while the upgraded items provide the foundation for the creation of a formidable chaos weapon.
